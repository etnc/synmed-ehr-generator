1. Distribution of Diagnoses:
What to visualize: The frequency of each diagnosis or disease in the generated records.
How to visualize:
Bar chart: Display the count of each diagnosis (or ICD code). This will give you an immediate sense of how frequently each condition appears in your records.
Pie chart: To show the proportion of each diagnosis relative to others.
Tools: You can use Python libraries like matplotlib or seaborn to create these visualizations.
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

diagnosis_counts = { "A00": 50, "A01": 30, "B01": 20 }  # Example
sns.barplot(x=list(diagnosis_counts.keys()), y=list(diagnosis_counts.values()))
plt.title("Distribution of Diagnoses")
plt.xlabel("Diagnosis Codes")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()


What to visualize: The medications prescribed based on diagnoses or the frequency of each medication.
How to visualize:
Bar chart or heatmap: Similar to diagnosis distribution, but for medications.
Tools: matplotlib or seaborn for bar charts, or pandas for heatmaps.
python
Copy code
medication_counts = {"Med1": 60, "Med2": 40}
sns.barplot(x=list(medication_counts.keys()), y=list(medication_counts.values()))
plt.title("Medication Distribution")
plt.xlabel("Medications")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()




Graphviz: Graphviz is a powerful tool for rendering graphs and diagrams. You can convert RDF triples into a format that Graphviz understands and generate a visual representation.

Use pygraphviz or networkx in Python to generate Graphviz-compatible graphs from RDF.


NetworkX: This Python library can also be used to create graph structures and visualize RDF data. It can convert RDF triples to a graph representation, and then visualize it using matplotlib.
