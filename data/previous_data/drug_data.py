Although cefoperazone has been shown to be clinically effective in the treatment of infections caused by enterococci in cases of peritonitis and other intra-abdominal infections, infections of the skin and skin structures, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometritis and other infections of the female genital tract, and urinary tract infections, the majority of clinical isolates of enterococci tested are not susceptible to cefoperazone but fall just at or in the intermediate zone of susceptibility, and are moderately resistant to cefoperazone. However, _in vitro_ susceptibility testing may not correlate directly with _in vivo_ results. Despite this, cefoperazone therapy has resulted in clinical cures of enterococcal infections, chiefly in polymicrobial infections. Cefoperazone should be used in enterococcal infections with care and at doses that achieve satisfactory serum levels of cefoperazone."

The following indications have shown promise and are backed up by some scientific evidence: schizophrenia (DHEA may be more effective in women than men); improving the appearance of older people\u2019s skin (taking DHEA by mouth seems to increase skin thickness and moisture, and decrease facial \u201cage spots\u201d in elderly men and women); improving ability to achieve an erection in men with sexual dysfunction. Additionally, DHEA has shown promise in improving symptoms of lupus (SLE). Taking DHEA by mouth along with conventional treatment may help reduce the number of times symptoms flare up and may allow a reduction in the dose of prescription drugs needed. DHEA may also help SLE symptoms such as muscle ache and mouth ulcers. DHEA also seems to strengthen bones in SLE patients being treated with high-dose steroids (corticosteroids).\r\nDHEA also shows promise in the treatment of osteoporosis. Taking DHEA by mouth daily seems to improve bone mineral density (BMD) in older women and men with osteoporosis or osteopenia (pre-osteoporosis). DHEA may also increase BMD in young women with the eating disorder called anorexia nervosa. DHEA is often prescribed in India for the induction of ovulation to improve chances of pregnancy."

Pixantrone is an attractive alternative as a second line agent, due to its lack of cardiac toxicity. [2] \r\n\r\nThe phase III trial, PIX-R, is ongoing and will compare pixantrone multidrug therapy with an equivalent regimen in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (the most common type of NHL).\r\n\r\nPrevious study results have also suggested the possibility that pixantrone may be safe and effective in doxorubicin naive patients. In myocardial strips which are doxorubicin naive, pixantrone is taken up to a higher degree than in myocardial strips which are doxorubicin exposed, and once absorbed exhibits redox inactivity. [3] \r\n\r\nPixantrone dimaleate has also been investigated as a treatment for acute myelogenous leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, metastatic breast cancer, low grade small lymphocytic lymphomas and general metastatic cancers.

Greater risk is associated with living in or traveling to areas of South America and Africa where yellow fever infection is officially reported at the time of travel and with traveling outside the urban areas of countries that do not officially report the disease but that lie in a yellow fever endemic zone.\r\n\r\n2. Persons Travelling Internationally Through Countries with Yellow Fever: Some countries require an individual to have a valid International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP) if the individual has been in countries either known or thought to harbor yellow fever virus. The certificate becomes valid 10 days after vaccination with Yellow Fever Vaccine.\r\n\r\n3. Laboratory Personnel: Laboratory personnel who handle virulent yellow fever virus or concentrated preparations of the yellow fever vaccine virus strains may be at risk of exposure by direct or indirect contact or by aerosols."

The few studies showed an antimicrobic effectiveness of beeswax against overall Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger.

Its function as a degradant of \u03b2-catenin, was also important, as it prevents the transcription of cell survival genes. All these factors have directed current research towards this kinase as a potential target.[A31603] Alzheimer disease is the most prevalent form of dementia. The most accepted hypothesis to explain this disease is related to the presence of amyloid \u03b2, which triggers a cascade that will alter the Tau protein and provoke synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death.[A31605] \r\n\r\nGSK-3 importance in the tissue repair pathway has also pointed out a novel application for tideglusib. Thus, it is also under the research for the natural repair treatment of deep caries lesions.[A31602] "

Firstly, it used to replenish potassium that has been depleted by conditions including but not limited to malabsorption, decreased intake, or excess sodium intake.  The causes of potassium deficiency are numerous. The following indications for potassium are not comprehensive, but include the main indications for which this nutrient is used. Various products and preparations contain potassium.\r\n\r\n**Potassium chloride**\r\n\r\nPotassium chloride is one of the main preparations of potassium used in a clinical setting. The oral solution is indicated for the prevention and treatment of hypokalemia presenting with or without metabolic alkalosis, in patients who have failed conservative management with potassium-rich foods or diuretic dose titrations.[L8744] The injection form of potassium chloride is indicated to replenish potassium in patients who are not feasible candidates for oral potassium. Highly concentrated potassium is intended for the treatment of potassium deficiency in fluid restricted individuals who cannot tolerate fluid volumes normally associated with injected potassium solutions that contain lower concentrations.[L8768]\r\nFinally, the extended-release tablet preparation of potassium chloride is used to treat hypokalemia with or without metabolic alkalosis, to treat digitalis intoxication, and to manage patients with hypokalemic familial periodic paralysis. It is also used in the prevention of hypokalemia in those who are at a high risk of negative clinical outcomes if hypokalemia occurs; patients on digitalis or those with cardiac arrhythmias would be at particular risk of negative outcomes.[L8771]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Potassium chloride with dextrose and sodium chloride** \r\n\r\nThis liquid preparation is is indicated in a clinical setting as a source of water, calories and electrolytes.[L8747] Potassium acetate solution is meant as an alternative to potassium chloride, replenishing potassium and added to large volume infusion fluids for intravenous injection.[L8759]\r\n\r\n**Potassium citrate**\r\n\r\nThe potassium citrate preparation is used for the management of renal tubular acidosis (RTA) with calcium stones (nephrolithiasis); calcium oxalate stones by any cause, and uric acid nephrolithiasis (with or without calcium stones). This regimen also includes adequate water intake (leading to a urine out put of 2 L/day or more) and sodium restriction.[L8753]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
